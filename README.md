## Building the Hellocharge Sample App

The hellocharge app is available in the `sample-hellocharge` folder.

Check out this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/square/point-of-sale-android-sdk.git
cd point-of-sale-android-sdk
```

Create a `hellocharge.properties` file in the `sample-hellocharge` folder, with a `clientId` key set to your application's client id which is the same as your application id in the Square Developer Portal (`sq0idp-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`). Do *NOT* use a sandbox `clientId`, as those do not work for the Point of Sale API.

```
echo clientId=\"put your production clientId here\" > sample-hellocharge/hellocharge.properties
```

And also create a `bikeshop.properties` file in the `sample-bikeshop` folder, with a `clientId` key set to your application's client id which is the same as your application id in the Square Developer Portal (`sq0idp-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`). Do *NOT* use a sandbox `clientId`, as those do not work for the Point of Sale API.

```
echo clientId=\"put your production clientId here\" > sample-bikeshop/bikeshop.properties
```

Build the SDK and the sample app:

```
./gradlew :sample-hellocharge:build
```

Add the [SHA1 fingerprint](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/pos-api/cookbook/find-your-android-fingerprint) of the sample app to your application dashboard:

```
keytool -printcert -jarfile ./sample-hellocharge/build/outputs/apk/debug/sample-hellocharge-debug.apk
```

Install the sample app:

```
./gradlew :sample-hellocharge:installDebug
```

## Bikeshop Sample App

The bikeshop is an example of a real point-of-sale application, available in the `sample-bikeshop` folder. To build this sample app, follow the same instructions as above, substituting "hellocharge" for "bikeshop".
